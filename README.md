# How Ray Are You? #

The goal of this project is a single-page web app that will quantify the
"Ray"ness of a block of text received as input.

## Work to be done ##

1. Gather Ray's corpus of emails from [his site](http://www.eslnotes.com/ray/6.html).
2. Gather a corpus of non-Ray emails.
3. Run a machine learning algorithm to yield a classifier.
4. Make an app that calls the classifier.
